# Astromancer by Skynet

Astromancer is a collection of intuitive data tools
based on the original [Skynet Plotting Tools](https://github.com/SkynetRTN/skynet-plotting).
It is designed to make data analysis easy for the students taking the intro-level astronomy lab course
[Our Place in Space!](https://skynet.unc.edu/astr101l)
and it's follow-up course [Multi Wavelength Universe!](https://openpress.usask.ca/skynet).

This project is based on the [Angular 16 framework](https://angular.io).
Some of the key libaries are
[Angular Material](http://material.angular.io),
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
[Handsontable](http://handsontable.com),
and [Highcharts](http://highcharts.com).

The first motivation for this project is to re-implement the functionality of the existing graphing tools, under a modern framework with a good design pattern to make it maintainable in the long term, even if not by its original authors.

The ultimate goal however, is to make observation data be understood intuitively by the students,
then inspire learning and facilitate research.
